#  e-commerce app

## Description

This project challenged me to use a mysql database 
and interact with it using node.js and the sequelize package.

During this project I learned how to:

- create a mysql database.
- make a connection with the database.
- create Models and seed it with data.
- use mysql workbench
- use the mysql2 package.
- use sequelize to run CRUD operations.
- use Insomnia to test the database.
- set up routes with express
